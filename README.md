# 8-Directions Mystery Solver

This program is designed to solve the mystery called "8 Directions". It processes an initial input from a .txt file, where it reads an 8-directional clue and searches for words within the provided file. By unscrambling the words and solving the riddle, the program reveals the final solution.

##Â How It Works

- Input: The program accepts a .txt file containing the 8-directional clues and a list of words.
- Processing: It reads the directional clues and compares them with the words in the file, attempting to unscramble them.
- Output: After all the words are identified, the program prints out the final, unscrambled riddle.

## Key Objective
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in working with 2D dynamic arrays in the C programming language. The program manipulates the array structure to navigate the directional clues and solve the puzzle.
